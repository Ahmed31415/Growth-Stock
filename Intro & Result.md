# Growth-Stock
This was part of my final project in my Intro to Financial Markets course. We were asked to pick a stock for a growth investor and explain using financial ratios and market situations as to why it is a good investment for them.
Nvidia was the stock I chose. The result was that it showed to be a great investment. It's stock price rose from $536.06 to $219.00 (after a 4:1 stock split).
